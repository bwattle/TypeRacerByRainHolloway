                        <h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>
                        <p>TypeRacer is a very <strong>simple</strong>, <strong>easy</strong> to play game.</p>
                        <p>
                            When you press the start button the game begins 
                            and the timer starts at 60 seconds. A word appears 
                            in the middle of the screen and you are required to 
                            type this word as fast as possible in the provided 
                            text box. Once you have finished typing the word, 
                            press spacebar to continue on to the proceeding word; 
                            as simple as normal typing. If you typed the word 
                            correctly, the word will be <span class="green">highlighted green</span>, 
                            however if you were incorrect, the word will be 
                            <span class="red">highlighted red</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When you are typing, letters that are correct will 
                            be <span class="green">highlighted green</span> and letters that are typed 
                            incorrectly will be <span class="red">highlighted red</span>. This allows you 
                            to identify mistakes <em>quickly</em> and <em>easily</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You do not have to type the entire word before moving 
                            onto the next word. If you find the word too difficult 
                            to type or you have made too many mistakes to backtrack, 
                            simply press spacebar and keep moving on. A score is kept 
                            track, incrementing each time a word is entered correctly. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The timer will turn red when you are approaching the end 
                            of the game at <span class="red-text">10 seconds</span>. When the timer hits 0, the game 
                            will end and you will be prompted for an anonymous username. 
                            If you beat one of the current 10 high-scores 
                            (Max of 10 high-scores), the previous high-score will be 
                            replaced with your username and score.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>You can click the start button at any time to restart the game.</strong>
